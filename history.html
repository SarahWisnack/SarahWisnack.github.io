         	<h1>JERSEY SHORE CAST</h1>
			<p>After a few seasons, Angelina Pivarnick left the show and was replaced by Deena Nicole Cortese. She and "Snooki" were very close and called themselves "The Meatballs". This nickname was a way of describing a woman who was short, bulky and loved to party. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-7 col-sm-7" data-wow-delay="1.6s">
			<h1>Where it all began</h1>
			<p>The Guido and Guidette subculture became popular around 2009 when the first season of the American reality show "Jersey Shore" aired on MTV. The cast was made up of four women and four men all in their 20s. They considered themselves Guido's and Guidette's and soon after were known across the country. The show took place in Seaside Heights, NJ where they lived in a beach house, worked on the boardwalk, and partied every day. After six seasons, their Guido/ Guidette culture was adapted by many in the New York/ New Jersey Tri-state area and still exists to this day. </p>
			<blockquote>Pictured from left to right is Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino, Jenni "Jwoww" Farley, DJ Pauly D, Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola, Ronnie Ortiz-Margo, "Snooki" Nicole Polizzi, Angelina Pivarnick, and Vinny Guadagnino. </blockquote>
			<img src="../assets/imgs/js_cast_2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="About">
			<p>The new edition to the show, Deena, brought iconic elements to the subculture such as the Jersey Turnpike dance move, the nickname "blast in a glass", and more. </p>

			<h1>Partying</h1>
			<p>A large aspect of this show was showing how these Guido's and Guidette's partied 24/7 and would go out almost every day. They would always go to clubs such as Karma, Bamboo, Beachcomber, and Aztec in Seaside Heights, NJ. This became an important element to this subculture because Guido's and Guidette's love to party, drink, and socialize to meet potention Guido/ Guidette partners. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
			<h1>Hook-Ups</h1>
			<p>Guido's and Guidette's have a sexual nature and are always on the prowl to find a companion. On the show, they would go out with the intention to bring home a Guido "gorilla juicehead" or a Guidette who was "DTF". They also had a designated room in the house called the "Smoosh Room" that was only for hooking up. Guido's and Guidette's use their physical appearance to lure the opposite sex in, bring them home to hook up, then will call them a cab first thing in the morning. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.2s">
			<h1>Work Life</h1>
			<p>If it is one thing a Guido or Guidette hates, it's working. They love to have fun, party, and socialize which they do not find in working. The cast of the Jersey Shore worked at a T-Shirt shop on the boardwalk and would always get into some trouble because they had no motivation to work. Guido's and Guidette's are uninspired to work because they either find it boring or because they are hungover from the night before.</p>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-6 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.4s">
			<h1>Dancing</h1>
			<p>Guido's and Guidette's express themselves sexually and physically through dancing. They will dance on tables at a bar, in the middle of the boardwalk or anywhere to have a good time. The Jersey shore cast created dance moves such as the fist pump, beating the beat up and the jersey turnpike. These dance moves have become a staple go-to move for Guido and Guidette subculture.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-6 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.6s">
			<h1>Bad Behavior</h1>
			<p>Guido's and Guidette's have the ability to go from 0-100. Although they are high energy and fun, they will not hesistate to fight if someone provokes them. "Jwoww" and Ronnie were known for getting into verbal and physical altercations. Some of these Guido's and Guidette's were also arrested while on the show due to public intoxication and for fighting. Guido's and Guidette's look at each other like family will go to war for one another. </p>
